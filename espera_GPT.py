"""
In this version, I removed the unnecessary imports of tkinter
and made some changes to the variable names to make them more
readable. I also moved the format string into the strptime()
call and removed the print() statement, since it didn't seem 
ecessary. Finally, I changed the showinfo() call to messagebox
showinfo() to be consistent with the import statement.


This will round time_final to the nearest minute and display
the rounded value in the messagebox.

In this updated code, after the user inputs the worked_time,
the code prompts the user to input the num_clients by calling
simpledialog.askinteger(). The function sets a minimum value of
1 and a maximum value of 100 for the input, but these values
can be adjusted as needed. The time_final calculation then
divides time_solo by the number of clients (num_clients)
to get the wait time for each client.
